> Translate Neo3-boa Python code to Coq code

```python
input = "üêç"

print("üêì")
```

[//] ## Status

[//] We focus on translating the Ethereum specification, which is written in Python: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs The output of the translation is in [CoqOfPython/ethereum](CoqOfPython/ethereum).

[//] The generated Coq code type checks, with some holes for expressions we do not handle yet. We are now working on adding a semantics to be able to specify at least one file.

[//] ## Run

[//] ### Translate Python to Coq

[//] Clone this repository and run:

[//] ```sh
[//] git submodule update --init --recursive
[//] ```

[//] as there are sub-modules. Then go in the `ethereum-execution-specs/src` folder and run:

[//] ```sh
[//] find ethereum -name "*.py" -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 python ../../main.py
[//] ```

[//] This will translate each file of the Ethereum specification to Coq and put the result in the `CoqOfPython/ethereum` folder.

[//] ### Compile the Coq

[//] Go into the `CoqOfPython` folder and install the dependencies with [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/):

[//] ```sh
[//] opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
[//] opam install --deps-only coq-of-python.opam
[//] ```

[//] Then, build the project (still in the `CoqOfPython` folder):

[//] ```sh
[//] make -j4
[//] ```

[//] It will compile all the Coq files, including the ones generated from the Ethereum specification and the proofs, so it might take some time.

[//] ## Documentation

[//] For now, the documentation is the code (everything is open-source), this README, and the following blog posts:
